# FTC Robotics Team Funding Proposal

**King's College London Mathematics School**

---

## Our Team

This year, we are launching an **FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) robotics team** at King's College London Mathematics School, led by **Carskey Chung** and **Kavan Vyas**. 

The FIRST Tech Challenge is an international robotics competition where teams of up to 15 students under 18 compete to build the best robot. Each year a new task is set, and new robots are built to score the most points possible. 

**This year's challenge:** Our task is to read a sequence of green and purple balls using a QR code, then shoot balls called "artifacts" into a hoop in the correct order. Opposing teams aim at hoops on opposite sides, playing defensively by focusing on getting more balls in or offensively by pushing their opponent.

As a **rookie 15-person team** competing for the first time, we hope to create a **legacy of robotics at KCLMS** and promote collaborative STEM – particularly by expanding robotics opportunities for both girls and boys at the school. Our members include aspiring engineers and programmers of all backgrounds, and we aim to show that **everyone has a place in STEM**. 

This year, our goal is to enter this competition as a strong challenger against well-established UK teams and experience the excitement of the competitive robotics scene.

## Investments to Date

So far, **£1,200 has been invested** into the club:
- **£300 registration fee** paid by the school
- **£900 bursary** generously provided by the FIRST organisation

However, to build a truly competitive robot, we estimate an additional **£1,500-£3,500 is required** for essential components such as mecanum wheels that would significantly improve our bot's performance. These features are vital if we are to compete at a later stage of the competition.

The starter kit bought using the bursary includes the most basic parts for building a robot that can move but not perform well.

## Why Sponsor Us?

Your investment would **directly impact what our team can achieve**. The biggest hurdle any FTC rookie team faces is the initial startup costs for equipment.

By sponsoring us, you will:
- **Support the next generation** of engineers and programmers
- **Increase diversity in STEM** by providing opportunities to students of all backgrounds
- **Gain brand visibility** at regional and national competitions
- **Demonstrate corporate social responsibility** through STEM education investment
- **Receive tax benefits** through educational charitable giving
- **Network with exceptional students** who may become future employees

## Impact and Legacy

FTC is **not intended to be a one-off project**—it has the potential to run every year at KCLMS so that students have an opportunity to learn a variety of skills from programming and CAD to collaboration. 

Furthermore, **most of the purchased equipment can be reused** by future cohorts, meaning that the costs for the project would decrease yearly.

We also aim to **inspire engineering in even younger cohorts** by doing regular outreach with local primary and secondary schools so that more children can be aware of the opportunities within STEM.

**We are building a permanent robotics pathway**, where each year experienced students train the next generation of young engineers and programmers.

---

## A Sustainable Investment

Through funding this inaugural year, you will be making a **high-impact, long-lifespan contribution** that will lower the barrier for every future team that follows on. 

This is a **uniquely sustainable investment** into the technical development of exceptional young engineers.

**Year 1 Investment:** £3,040  
**Year 2+ Estimated Costs:** <£500 annually *(reusing existing equipment)*

Your investment today creates opportunities for dozens of students over the coming years.
